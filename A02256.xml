            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE excellent Prince and Lorde <hi>Morrice</hi> of <hi>NaÅ¿Å¿ow, &amp;c.</hi> hauing reÅ¿cued <hi>Coeuerden,</hi> where the common Enemie with all his power on foote and on horÅ¿ebacke, had lyne al the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Å¿trengthened himÅ¿elfe with Å¿undrie Trenches, againÅ¿t the inÅ¿urrection of our people, hath not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding not tarryed the comming of our Campe, but hath left the CaÅ¿tle of <hi>Coeuerden,</hi> with all her Trenches and Campes.</p>
            <p>Which done, his Highnes came before <hi>Groning,</hi> the 20. of May, viewed the Cittie, and Å¿ummoned it. Their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿were was, that they Å¿hould firÅ¿t lye a yeere &amp; a day before it, and then Å¿houlde Å¿ummon the Å¿ame. There Å¿houlde you haue Å¿Ã©ene many kindes of cariages, in very great quantitie, of rafters, poÅ¿tes, Deales, plancks and boords, where-with many Ships were laden. There was tenne Ships Å¿ent from <hi>Gorcum</hi> with boordes, beÅ¿ides many hundreds which came from <hi>Swoll</hi> and other places, and were beÅ¿poken.</p>
            <p>There came to the Campe before <hi>Groning,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> my Lords the States, vnder the conduct of his Highnes, about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fortie EnÅ¿ignes of footemen: as high Dutch, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿hmen, Scots, Netherlanders, and FrÃ©eÅ¿landers. The FreeÅ¿landers vnder the conduct of <hi>William</hi> Earle of <hi>NaÅ¿Å¿ow.</hi> There was viij. EnÅ¿ignes preÅ¿ently Å¿ent before the Forte at <hi>Aurikeizill,</hi> to take in the Å¿ame: for they held out Å¿toutly, and attended for fiue EnÅ¿ignes, that came with bridges &amp; Ladders for the aÅ¿Å¿ault.</p>
            <p>And Å¿tanding readie to employ all their might thereon, there came three other EnÅ¿ignes from the other Å¿ide, with bridges, many bu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>dles of BulruÅ¿hes bound together in Å¿acks, pitched and nayled vnder Tables made of Deale-bords, ouer which they ranne to the wall of the Fort. They which had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:27749:3"/> no Ladders, did Å¿ticke their daggers in, and climed vp by them. The people Å¿Ã©eing that they were ouer-fallen, cryed for grace, but it was too late: for they had Å¿poken very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious words to the DromÅ¿ter, wherefore they were all ouer-come, and of one hundred and thirty, there was not fiue left aliue. Which was no Å¿mall feare to them of <hi>Groning<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> as alÅ¿o the driuing out of their folke out of the Trenche at <hi>Hogherbrug.</hi> So that they of <hi>Groning,</hi> were conÅ¿trained to driue their Cattell vnder the Towne wall, where they could not all be kept, but Å¿ome were fedde with Hay in the Cittie. There was about foure-Å¿core of thoÅ¿e without, which were taken by our men.</p>
            <p>After this, they iÅ¿Å¿ued forth of the Citty in Å¿undry places vpon our men, with the helpe of fiue EnÅ¿ignes of Souldiers, that lay in <hi>Shutendiepe,</hi> which place is Å¿trongly defended Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally from the Citty, lying vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water called the <hi>Vaert<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi>) which the Coronell made at that time. With this their iÅ¿Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, they did our folkes very much harme. But after we had made our Trenches, digged our Lope-ditches, &amp; Å¿treng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened the Å¿ame, their left they of their iÅ¿Å¿uing out.</p>
            <p>Great was the carefulnes of his Highnes and my Lords the States, in the fortifying and making Å¿ure of our Campe, towards all quarters, where any feare was of aÅ¿Å¿aulting. And then employing all their force againÅ¿t the Citty, with dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and placing of their Ordinance. Yea, in thrÃ©e places they came to their very wall, Å¿o that in two places, they digged and vndermined twenty and thirtie foote within their Wall. They within reÅ¿ted not, but defended themÅ¿elues: inÅ¿omuch that through their manifold Å¿hooting, there was founde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue two thouÅ¿and pellets.</p>
            <p>Heereby is to be coniectured, that they Å¿hotte foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and Å¿hotte at the leaÅ¿t, with great Ordinaunce. For at the beginning they were prouided with foure hundred Barrells of powder, which were leÅ¿Å¿ned to fiftie, and yet were not they of the beÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>Vppon the Gate called the <hi>Herren Port,</hi> were eight great peeces placed, and wholie Å¿hot of. There were many houÅ¿es
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:27749:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> Å¿haken, and Å¿poyled with the Ordinance, and Å¿omtimes with fire-works out of the Campe, and balles of wild-fire, which in Å¿under places did Å¿ette theyr houÅ¿es on fire: where-vppon preÅ¿ently followed pellets of Å¿tone, and hayle-Å¿hot mingled with wild-fire. Whereby the hearts of the Cittizens began heere and there to faint, and were brought to Å¿uch point, that they tooke pledges one of another.</p>
            <p>The Rulers were brought to Å¿uch extremety, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauiate the matter, (not Å¿o much through the beÅ¿ieging, but by certaine Souldiers of <hi>Sluiten-deepe,</hi> which were let into the Citty,) that they were forced to hold their handes, which made a rumor in the Citty, inÅ¿omuch that Å¿ome loÅ¿t theyr lyues by it. Thys being Å¿tilled and pacified, the Souldiours had afterwards no good reÅ¿t or quietnes for want of Å¿leepe, by reaÅ¿on of theyr continuall watching. The chiefe of them was occaÅ¿ion heereby to write to <hi>Don Verdugo,</hi> for a Å¿upply of Souldiours, munition, and money. One of the carryers of theÅ¿e Letters was Å¿laine, and hanged vp againÅ¿t the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: the other was pardoned, becauÅ¿e hee bewrayed the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the Citty.</p>
            <p>Vpon the Roundell (which was made long agoe, and in the time of Duke <hi>Daline,</hi> called <hi>The CaÅ¿tle,</hi>) were alÅ¿o eyght great pÃ©eces of Ordinance planted, one of the corners wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was wholy Å¿hotte downe, and Å¿o made vnfenceable. His Highnes through his diligence and endeuour going heere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to Å¿ee the manner, a Å¿hotte light vpon his Trench, that thoÅ¿e which Å¿toode harde by him, were thereby Å¿princkled in their faces.</p>
            <p>One of the three mynes vnder the Å¿ayde Roundell, named <hi>Rauelin,</hi> was digged, which beeing perceiued by them of the Citty, was countermined, by which our men entred, placing of their powder, and alarme preÅ¿ently giuen. WhilÅ¿t they of the Citty were Å¿etting of their watch at the Å¿aide <hi>Rauelin,</hi> the powder was by a traine Å¿uddainly Å¿et on fire, with Å¿uch thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering noyÅ¿e and duÅ¿t, that for the Å¿pace of three houres, one man coulde not Å¿Ã©e another. The chiefeÅ¿t Lieutenant was alÅ¿o Å¿layne.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:27749:4"/>
            <p>The Reader may well thinke, howe armes, legges and and whole bodies of men, were blowne away in the ayre, for two of them fell into our Trenches, wherof one was yet aliue. Thys Bulwarke brake and fell downe, according as we wiÅ¿hed, and hath made a braue bancke. AlÅ¿o the way fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp betweene <hi>Rauelin</hi> and the Cittie, our men crept in, without loÅ¿ing of any one man: where they founde Å¿ixe pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ordinance, and certaine men wrapped vp in the earth, which were yet aliue. The Å¿ame day in the Euening in Å¿et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our watch, we loÅ¿t eyght Souldiours.</p>
            <p>They in the Cittie Å¿eeing this, were at their wits end, as if the day of Iudgement had beene come. Straightwaies <hi>Iohn den Boer,</hi> or <hi>Iohn the Clowne,</hi> was Å¿ent out with a Taber and a pype, yet that day all was not ended. But the next day, they of the Cittie, vpon good aÅ¿Å¿urance and promiÅ¿e of his Highnes, came forth in foure Å¿euerall companies, that is to Å¿ay, the Clergie, the MagiÅ¿trates, the chiefeÅ¿t of the Souldiours, and the men of Occupations. One of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> would not truÅ¿t another. Heerevpon his Highnes Å¿aid vnto them, Looke what you agree to, is wholie giuen you through my liberalitie: for I count my Å¿elfe aÅ¿Å¿ured of the Citty. In the end, after many debatings, the xxij. day of Iulie, theÅ¿e Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles following were agreed vpon.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. FirÅ¿t, that his HighneÅ¿Å¿e for the firÅ¿t time, may diÅ¿place the MagiÅ¿trate, and place him again, and the Å¿worne Communaltie, at his pleaÅ¿ure.</item>
               <item>2. That the Gildes or Companies Å¿hall in that reÅ¿pect, be Å¿et a Å¿ide, that they Å¿hall haue nothing to Å¿ay in the policie of the Cittie. But the CounÅ¿ell Å¿hall deale therein with the Å¿worne Communaltie, Å¿uch as the CounÅ¿ell will vÅ¿e therevnto.</item>
               <item>3. That his Highnes may put Souldiours into the Cittie at his pleaÅ¿ure: but yet in Å¿uch manner as is vÅ¿ed in FreeÅ¿land.</item>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:27749:4"/>
               <item>4. That the Cittie Å¿hall renounce the King, and declare him their enemie. And alÅ¿o bee Å¿eaÅ¿ed with ImpoÅ¿ts or any others, as the Citties in FreeÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande.</item>
               <item>5. That no other Religion be Å¿uffered, but onlie the true reformed Religion.</item>
               <item>6. That during theÅ¿e warres, his Highnes Å¿hal yeerely chooÅ¿e out fiue of the Å¿worne Communalty, which Å¿hall appoynt the CounÅ¿ell.</item>
               <item>7. That the GarriÅ¿on of the Enemie Å¿hall paÅ¿Å¿e ouer the <hi>Rhine,</hi> leauing their EnÅ¿ignes behind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. And Å¿wearing in thrÃ©e moneths not to Å¿erue on this Å¿ide the Å¿ame.</item>
